# LSTM Fake News Classifier
This is a Github repoository where I will be building a Fake News classifier, built using PyTorch and deployed on Amazon SageMaker.

Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The data is processed using a bag-of-words technique.

Some code has been adapted from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer first course project.
