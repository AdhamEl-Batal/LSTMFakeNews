# LSTM Fake News Classifier
This is a Github repoository where I will be building a Fake News classifier, built using PyTorch and deployed on Amazon SageMaker.

Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The data is processed using a bag-of-words technique.

Please note that this is STILL <b><font color = blue>a work in progress</b></font>! 
While the main engine of the code (`train.py` and `model.py`) files are pretty much done, the subsequent analysis in the Jupyter notebok, uploaded here as an HTML file, will still change.

Once I am satisfied with the results of the analysis in the Jupyter notebook, I will include more detailed results on deployment and usage in this README.

But for now, feel free to view the analysis here: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AdhamEl-Batal/LSTMFakeNews/blob/main/LSTMFakeNew_Jupyter_Analysis.html
It has lots of information on how to pre-process and fit the data!


Some code has been adapted from the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer first course project.
